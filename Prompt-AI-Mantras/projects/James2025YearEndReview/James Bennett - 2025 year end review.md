## Year Review and Mid‑Year Review  

**Title:** *A Year of Change and Adaptation*  

---

## Executive Summary

### Year‑End Review
This past year required adaptation and versatility. I enjoy learning and applying my technical expertise across many vectors. Now that I'm a **Principal Applications Developer (Software Engineer)**, I have been involved more around process and organizational observations or opinions. This meant that I worked with **ESA on SparkLynx**, **DevSecOps** on supporting various server applications, and on **Standard Notes for Mechanical Solutions (Mechanical Engineers – SMS)** at the beginning of the year.  

A rift seems to have formed nearly 10 years ago between Engineering and IT at Ball Aerospace, long before I started working here. It has become clear to me that efforts to build better working relationships with my engineering peers are necessary and would improve overall working efficiency. I think this will be a necessary step in establishing expectations around software development and other IT‑related tasks.

### Mid‑Year Review Highlights
My accomplishments and progress as a Principal Applications Developer at BAE Systems include:

- Successfully adapting to changes in my role and delivering high‑quality solutions for multiple teams.  
- Building custom applications, improving processes, enhancing team collaboration, and providing personal training to support DevSecOps and MBSE.  

**Key achievements:**

- Developing and deploying custom applications for MechS, DevSecOps, and MBSE teams.  
- Improving processes and enhancing team collaboration.  
- Building CI/CD pipelines and Windows installers for various projects.  
- Providing training and support to team members.  
- Pursuing ongoing training and professional development.  

I am committed to continuing to support my teams and drive innovation in software development and DevSecOps at BAE Systems.

## Detailed Highlights of the Year So Far  

### MechS – Standard Notes (Scribe, Composer, and SolidWorks Tools)
- Analyzed and fixed numerous bugs and customer‑requested adjustments resulting from QA testing and customer usage.  
- Created weekly QA releases in Azure DevOps via CI/CD build and release pipelines.  
- Collaborated with Jamie, Isaac, Venkata, and Jason Gary to release versions to production.  
- Tested Advanced Installer (setup process for StandardNotes) on Windows 11 and confirmed basic functionality.  
- Initiated troubleshooting Fortify scans for StandardNotes and worked with Keith Kernes on this issue.  
- Improved user messaging for OmniExporter in SolidWorks Tools.  
- Resolved Message Queues errors.  
- Assisted with analysis on preparing Standard Notes for the BPN.  
- Further development was put on pause by the Mechanical Solutions department in **April 2025**.

### Training
- Began training for **Sec+ Certification**, completing roughly **2/3 to 3/4** of the material.  
- Obtained the necessary course material and test/retake from CompTIA to complete this training this year.  
- Plan to complete Sec+ training and obtain certification before year‑end.

### Parental Leave
- My son **Gavin** was born on **April 1, 2025**. I took the month of April off for parental leave to support my wife and family during this important time.  
- I appreciate the company’s provision of this benefit and would advocate for similar benefits for others in the future.  
- **Minor feedback:** Providing more time for individuals would be an improvement in employee benefits. I’m grateful for the month I had off to adjust with my family.

### MBSE Efforts (Project name ideas: Jameo, JamaSync, JiraSync, SparkLynx)
- Read and analyzed the entire code bases: **Enchant** (Java, Rust, Go), **Jameo‑Cameo Plugin** (Java), **JamaSync** (Python), **Companion** (Python), **rust‑zmq** (Rust), and researched developer documentation for Cameo/MagicDraw from NoMagic/Dessault.  
- Assisted with analysis for Java conversion of the Jameo plugin, helping to create tasks and scope work as needed.  
- Assisted with analysis for **Option 1** and **Option 2**, helping to create tasks and scope work as needed.  
- Finished **Option 2** project for **SparkLynx**.  
- Built CI/CD pipelines for **Jameo Cameo** (Java) and **JamaSync** (Python).  
- Created Windows installers for both plugins, which will be approved and added to Software Center soon.  
- Assisted Jamie and Isaac with coding issues, developer environment setup, and other areas as needed.  
- **Future idea:** Build a VSCode extension to make the debug process and development cycle more accessible to other software engineers on the ESS and SMS (ESA) sides of the business.

### DevSecOps Team
- Joined the DevSecOps team in **May**.  
- Underwent training in **GitLab**, **GitLab CI/CD pipelines**, **Docker**, **Rancher**, **Podman**, and **Kubernetes**.  
- Attended daily stand‑ups to learn processes and recent issues being addressed by the team.  
- Built a Windows runner to operate Docker containers for GitLab, enabling jobs to run in the **BSF/Aero** instance of GitLab through the Windows operating system.  
- Coordinated messages between the SparkLynx/Jameo project and the DevSecOps team as needed during stand‑ups.

### Compliance
- Upgraded Azure DevOps server application to **2022.2** and applied **Patch 5**, bringing the application up to date and within compliance.  
- Set up Fortify scans via CI/CD pipelines for **StandardNotes**, **SparkLynx**, **Fusion** projects, and **PLMPortal** (CDM team).

### AI Development Environment
- Learned, with help from the AI group, how to set up my VSCode with **Mission Assist AI** and have contributed to documentation and basic setup for use in my development environment.

## Going Forward
- **Prioritize stabilizing SparkLynx** and supporting that project going forward; train coworkers to ensure robust support.  
- Continue working with **Jose Salazar** and the DevSecOps team, creating automation and time‑saving projects to enhance team effectiveness.  
- Contribute to **Digital Engineering initiatives** and the **PLM project**.  
- Pursue further training in **Artifactory, GitLab, GitLab CI/CD, BSF Pipelines, Containers, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform**, and other areas relevant to the DevSecOps team or SparkLynx project.
