## 2025 Year-End Review

**Title:** *A Year of Adaptation, Cross-Functional Impact, and Strategic Bridge-Building*

---

## Executive Summary

This year I successfully navigated significant role changes as **Principal Applications Developer**, delivering high-impact solutions across multiple business-critical initiatives: **MBSE tooling (SparkLynx/Jameo)**, **DevSecOps infrastructure**, and **compliance modernization**.

**Key Themes:**

- **Versatility & Adaptability:** Transitioned across ESA, DevSecOps, and Mechanical Solutions domains, consistently delivering production-ready solutions
- **Cross-Functional Leadership:** Proactively identified and began addressing longstanding IT-Engineering relationship gaps that impact organizational efficiency
- **Technical Excellence:** Built CI/CD pipelines, compliance tooling, and Windows infrastructure that directly support business objectives and security posture

**Strategic Observation:**
A organizational rift between Engineering and IT (predating my tenure by nearly a decade) creates friction that impacts project velocity and collaboration. Building stronger working relationships with engineering peers is a strategic priority that will improve efficiency and establish clearer expectations around software development and IT services.
