# Agents Quickstart

This file captures the current coordination context so any new AI agent can resume work quickly.

## Repository
- Path: `/mnt/d/development/ai-personas-and-patterns`
- Primary references: `personas-and-patterns-context.md`, `project-plan.md`, `prompt-wiki/`

## Latest State
- Layer 1 patterns complete: planning-phase, orchestration, recursive-self-eval, meta-rules.
- Layer 2 patterns complete: chain-of-thought, rule-based reasoning, guardrail creative.
- Core personas established: Clara-Financial-Analyst, Kestra-Systems-Architect, Goeth-Philosophical-Synthesizer, Hopper-Project-Planner, Lovell-Crisis-Planner, Bernstein-Orchestrator, Ada-QA-Reviewer, Franklin-Deep-Reasoner.
- `prompt-wiki/README.md` documents usage and workflow.

## Active Focus
1. Design additional personas (Judge, Lawyer, Policeman, Nurse, Doctor, Scholar, Mathematician, Politician, CEO) with rich inspirations.
2. (Future) Populate `projects/` with applied orchestration examples.

## Working Agreements
- Follow naming convention `Name-Role.md` for personas.
- Use patterns from `prompt-wiki/patterns/` per persona recommendations.
- Default workflow: Bernstein → Hopper/Lovell (planning) → worker personas (Clara/Kestra/etc.) → Ada (QA) with recursive self-eval.
- Prefer additive edits; preserve historical context.

## Reboot Instructions
1. Read `agents.md` (this file) plus `personas-and-patterns-context.md` and `project-plan.md` to load mental model.
2. Inspect `prompt-wiki/README.md` and `prompt-wiki/personas/` to refresh persona capabilities.
3. Check open tasks from “Active Focus” and confirm with user which to tackle first.
4. Use orchestration pattern to plan next steps before executing.
