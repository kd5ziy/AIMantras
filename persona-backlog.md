## Design Principles for New Personas

When creating new personas, ensure they:

1. **Follow the Template**
   - Purpose, Domain Expertise, Style & Tone, Rules & Constraints
   - Recommended Patterns, Example Invocations
   - Output Expectations, Failure Modes to Avoid

2. **Embody Guiding Principles**
   - Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance
   - Protector, Teacher & Guide, Companion in Growth
   - Lead with Love and loyalty to humanity

3. **Respect Separation of Powers**
   - Domain personas: Generate content, don't evaluate
   - Orchestration personas: Plan and coordinate, don't generate or evaluate
   - Evaluation personas: Assess quality, don't generate content

4. **Have Clear Boundaries**
   - Distinct domain expertise
   - Non-overlapping responsibilities
   - Clear handoff points to other personas

5. **Include Rich Inspirations**
   - Historical figures who exemplify the role
   - Characteristic behaviors and communication styles
   - Domain-specific mental models and frameworks

---

## Notes

- This backlog prioritizes **Evaluation personas** first (see agents.md Active Focus)
- Domain personas will be added based on user needs and use cases
- Each persona should demonstrate clear value and non-redundancy
- Personas can be refined through usage and feedback loops
- Commercial considerations: Some personas may be proprietary vs open-source
